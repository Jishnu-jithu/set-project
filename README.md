# Set Project Blender Add-on

The “Set Project” is a powerful and user-friendly addon for Blender that enhances your workflow and productivity. Inspired by the project management features in Maya, this addon introduces a new feature that allows you to set the project in a more organized and efficient manner.

## Key Features

- **Presets**: Choose from default settings or create custom presets for your projects.
- **Project Organization**: Effortlessly manage project names, locations, and folders.
- **Saving Options**: Customize file names, compression settings, and path remapping.
- **Folder Updates**: Keep projects up-to-date with automatic or manual folder refresh options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design and simple controls make project management easy.

## Simple Workflow

1. **Set Project Details**: Begin by defining your project name and location.
2. **Folder Management**: Add or delete folders to structure your project effectively.
3. **Saving Customization**: Tailor saving options to meet your specific project needs.
4. **Save Project**: Click the "Save Project" button to finalize your project setup.

## Seamless Integration

The add-on goes a step further by seamlessly recognizing folders created outside of Blender using Windows Explorer. This feature ensures a smooth and intuitive workflow, allowing users to adapt their projects effortlessly.

Enhance your Blender experience with the Set Project add-on, simplifying the complexities of project management.
